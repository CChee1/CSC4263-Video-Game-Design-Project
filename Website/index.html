		<h2>Gameplay</h2>

		<h3>The Basics</h3>
		<p>In TrainPain, your goal as the player is to aquire the highest score 
			you can. To increase your score you collect coins to unlock more train 
			cars as you go thorugh a level. Your final score is tallied when complete 
			a level by pulling into a station, unless you are playing endless mode 
			of course, and your number of train cars and other stats determine your score.
			This may sound simple, but the whole time you are having to ovoid obstacles such as 
			buildings.
		</p>
		<h3>Story Mode</h3>
		<p>The main way to play TrainPain is through story mode. Where the player tries to complete 
			the levels by reaching the end with most amount of traincars. Along the way the player 
			collects coins to increase their score and avoid buildings that would decrease their score.
