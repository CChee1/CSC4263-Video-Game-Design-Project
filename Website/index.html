		<h2>Gameplay</h2>

		<h3>The Basics</h3>
		<p>In TrainGang, your goal as the player is to aquire the highest score 
			you can. To increase your score you collect coins to unlock more train 
			cars as you go thorugh a level. Your final score is tallied when complete 
			a level by pulling into a station, unless you are playing endless mode 
			of course, and your number of train cars and other stats determine your score.
			This may sound simple, but the whole time you are having to ovoid obstacles such as 
			buildings, trees, rocks, space rocks, and maybe some aquatic animals.
		</p>
		<h3>Modes</h3>
		<p>
			The first mode avaliable is story mode. The goal of story mode to reach endless space. 
			To do so you will first have to pass through many other enviroments on earth. As a player 
			you will start out in a city with goal of passing the level without dying. If you do that 
			then you will move on to the next level which is determined by the amount of train cars 
			that successfully pulled into the station. From there you will continue onto each enviroment 
			until you successfully beat the story and end up in space. 
		</p>
		<p>The second mode, endless, is pretty simple. You start, but you don't finish. Your goal is to just go 
			and try to beat your highscore, going from random enviroment to enviroment.
